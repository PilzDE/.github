# Definition of ready (DoR)
- Each user story should fulfill the INVEST criteria (see e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)), [scrum-in-der-praxis.de](https://scrum-in-der-praxis.de/glossary/invest))
  - See https://www.knowledgehut.com/tutorials/scrum-tutorial/definition-of-ready
    - Independent (of all others)
    - Negotiable (not a contract for a specific feature)
    - Valuable (a vertical slice)
    - Estimable (to a decent approximation)
    - Small (enough to fit in a single iteration)
    - Testable (even if the test doesn't exist yet)

## Further requirements
- The user story is Well-defined:
  - The user story should be written in the user story format, see for example [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Principle).
  - e.g. `As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>`
- Acceptance criteria are defined (see point 7 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/10-tips-for-writing-good-user-stories))
  - The description states clearly which conditions have to be fulfilled such that the story is done.
  - The team knows how to "demonstrate" the user story to the user. In other words, the team knows the value for the user/stakeholder.
  - "Without such criteria developers may not really understand the scope of the work or how it will be tested and validated." (Source: [scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/walking-through-definition-ready))
- Diagrams are used to support the understanding (see point 10 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/10-tips-for-writing-good-user-stories))
- No implicit knowledge
  - If possible, all information that the team requires to understand a User-story should be written down.
   - Whenever new knowledge is gained regarding the User-story, it should be written down in the User-story, to promote information exchange.
 - "Dependencies are identified and no external dependencies would block the PBI from being completed." (Source: [informit.com](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1928232&seqNum=5))
 - If external documents (e.g. specs) are needed for the story they are collected and provided with the story.
 - If external help is needed the feasibility of getting this help is ensured. (Maybe even dates are set)
  - External dependencies may be present at the start of the PBI but it must be foreseeable that they are solved by the end of the work


## General notes
- Stories are developed iteratively (talks with Stakeholder, Sprint-Refinement, (Sprint-Review), Sprint-Planning, etc.).

### Why do we need a Definition of ready (DoR)?
- DoR reduce "requirements churn" during the actual sprint when the story is developed (Source: [infoq.com](https://www.infoq.com/news/2014/06/using-definition-of-ready/))
- "By observing a Definition of Ready, the chances are reduced of a Sprint starting where Development Team members immediately shake their heads at Product Backlog items they do not sufficiently understand." (Source: [scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/walking-through-definition-ready))
