# Definition of ready (DoR)
- Each user story should fulfills the INVEST criteria (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)) or [srum-in-der-praxis.de](https://scrum-in-der-praxis.de/glossary/invest))

## In detail
- The user story is Well-defined:
  - The user story should be written in the user story format, see for example [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Principle).
- Acceptance criteria are defined (see point 7 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/10-tips-for-writing-good-user-stories))
  - What points need to be fulfilled, in order, for the PO to approve the story?
  - The conditions are described which have to be fulfilled so that the story is done.
  - The team knows how to "demonstrate" the user story to the user. In other words, the team knows the value for the user/stakeholder.
- Diagrams are used to support the understanding (see point 10 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/10-tips-for-writing-good-user-stories))
- No implicit knowledge
  - All information regarding a User-story should be written down in easy to understand sentences. Reason: It only takes a few minutes to write valuable information down but it takes ages to fix implementations based on incorrectly understood information.

## General notes
- Stories are developed iteratively (Talks with Stakeholder, Sprint-Refinement, (Sprint-Review), Sprint-Planning, etc.)

### Why do we need a Definition of ready (DoR)?
- "oR reduce "requirements churn" during the actual sprint when the story is developed (Source [infoq.com](https://www.infoq.com/news/2014/06/using-definition-of-ready/))
- "By observing a Definition of Ready, the chances are reduced of a Sprint starting where Development Team members immediately shake their heads at Product Backlog items they do not sufficiently understand."
